## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a popular tool for semantic text processing.

Rachel Hines and Shreya Pandey present a comprehensive analysis of the performance of
several LLMs on different semantic tasks and categories, such as reasoning, summarization,
bias and text formatting. They also extend the analysis with information on speed and
resource usage for each of the LLMs that are analyzed. Each LLM under study shows
different peculiarities, making the choice of the best LLM high dependent on the use case.
They provide guidance on choosing LLMs.
